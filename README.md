# Smart-Home-Security-System

Developed a miniature smart home security system with Arduino that utilizes multiple analog and digital sensors, such as photocell sensors to detect light changes, PSD sensors to detect motion, infrared sensors to detect interruptions, sound sensors to detect noise levels, and touch sensors to detect physical contact for different intrusion scenarios
